# Heathrow ASIC

The Heathrow ASIC is an intergrated I/O controller designed for use in Power
Macintosh G3 computers.

Its predecessors are Grand Central and O'Hare ASICs used in other Power Macintosh
computers. As those names suggest, Apple engineers liked to name their I/O controllers
after airports and train stations.

Heathrow and its siblings are collectively referred to as __mac-io__ devices in the
OpenFirmware device tree.

## Mac I/O family

The purpose of a Mac I/O (MIO) controller is to bring support for Apple legacy
I/O hardware to the PCI-based Power Macintosh. That legacy hardware has
existed long before Power Macintosh was introduced. It includes:
- versatile interface adapter (VIA)
- Sander-Woz integrated machine (SWIM) that is a floppy disk controller
- CUDA MCU that controls ADB, parameter RAM, realtime clock and power management
- serial communication controller (SCC)
- Macintosh Enhanced SCSI Hardware (MESH)

In the 68k Macintosh era, all this hardware was implemented in separate ICs.
In a PCI-compatible Power Macintosh, the above devices are part
of the MIO chip itself. MIO's functional blocks implementing the above devices
are called __cells__, i.e. "VIA cell", "SWIM cell" etc.

MIO itself is PCI compliant while the legacy hardware it emulates isn't.
MIO occupies 512Kb of the PCI memory space divided into registers space and
DMA space. Access to emulated legacy devices is accomplished by reading from/
writing to MIO's PCI address space at predefined offsets.

MIO includes a DMA controller that offers 15 DMA channels implementing
Apple's own DMA protocol called descriptor-based DMA (DBDMA).

Official documentation (that is somewhat incomplete and erroneous) can be
found in the second chapter of the book "Macintosh Technology in the Common
Hardware Reference Platform" by Apple Computer, Inc.

## Heathrow I/O modules

Being a Mac I/O compatible device, the Heathrow ASIC contains the following modules/cells:

* VIA cell for establishing communication with the Cuda MCU (separate IC)
* ATA/IDE cell for controlling ATA-3 compatible drives
* enhanced serial communication controller (ESCC cell)
* Ethernet controller cell funnily called __bmac__
* floppy disk controller (SWIM3 cell)
* SCSI controller (MESH cell)
* integrated DBDMA controller
* interrupt controller
* logic for controlling built-in audio HW
* logic for accessing NVRAM (separate IC)
* logic for controlling a media bay on portables

## PCI configuration space registers

| Register name | Default value  |
|:-------------:|:--------------:|
| VendorID      | 0x106B (Apple) |
| DeviceID      | 0x0010         |
| RevisionID    | 0x01           |
| Class code    | 0xFF0000       |

It looks like Heathrow supports only one Base Address Register - __BAR0__.
It contains base address of the memory-mapped registers programmed by system software
during system initialization.

## Memory-mapped registers

Software communicates with the Heathrow ASIC via memory-mapped registers that
occupy 512 Kb starting from the base address located in the BAR0 register
in the PCI configuration space.

Macintosh firmware configures the Heathrow ASIC to live at address `0xF3000000`.
